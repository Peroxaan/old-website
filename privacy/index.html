            <p class="lead">Here at Peroxaan Studios, we believe in protecting our users privacy. Therefore, all of our products are designed to collect little to no data about you, and anything that is collected is purely data that the user consents to provide. When we’re collecting data, you will know. We don’t collect anything without letting our users know.</p>
            <p class="lead">In Talon for iOS, as of version 1.1 - nothing is being collected by Peroxaan. All data you input in the App is handled within the App, and we do not have access to any of that data. If you choose to save links inside of the app, that data is handled by Apple with iCloud, and will sync across your devices with the same Apple ID.</p>
	    <p class="lead">In Aerosketch for iOS, as of beta 16 - nothing is being collected from the users by Peroxaan. However, since we support Game Center for Leaderboards and Achievements, some data will be collected by Apple to support that. However, there is no information that we hold. That is subject to change in the future. </p>
            <p class="lead">In Electrocam for iOS, as of beta 4 - nothing is being collected from the users by Peroxaan, and nothing is being collected by any third parties. This may change in the future.</p>
	    <p class="lead">In Clicker for iOS, as of beta 6 - nothing is being collected from the users by Peroxaan. However, since we support Game Center for Leaderboards and Achievements, some data will be collected by Apple to support that. However, there is no information that we hold. That is subject to change in the future.</p>
            <p class="lead">In Ruby for iOS, as of beta 2 - nothing is being collected from the users by Peroxaan, however this is subject to change.</p>
            <p class="lead">In Peroxaan Stickers for iOS, as of version 2.0 - nothing is being collected from the users by Peroxaan, and this will not be changing.</p>
            <p class="lead">For all of our apps, there are links to external websites - such as Twitter. We have no control over what data they may collect. For that information, please read their respective privacy policies.</p>
            <p class="lead">Also, for all apps - we have access to your Crash Reports and Feedback, if you choose to submit it. Your name and email may be shared if you submit a crash or send feedback.</p>
